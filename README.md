OAuth2
------

A PHP wrapper for the OAuth 2.0 specification. This is a work in progress, being built first to solve the pragmatic process of connecting to existing OAuth 2.0 endpoints (a.k.a. Facebook) with the goal of building it up to meet the entire specification over time.


Requirements
============

* PHP 5.3.x
* HTTP (<http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http>)
